.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B protoc-gen-go
is a filter for the
.BR protoc (1)
protocol buffer compiler.
It takes the protocol buffer format from
.BR protoc (1)
as input and produces Go code as output which can then be used to
encode (marshal) and decode (unmarshal) data in the protocol buffer
format specified in its input. The input is typically produced by
.BR protoc (1)
by taking a .proto input file and converting it to a protocol buffer
descriptor format which
.B protoc-gen-go
can then read.
If
.B protoc-gen-go
can be found in the regular search path, the
.I --plugin
flag can be omitted.
.SH OPTIONS
.B protoc-gen-go
itself doesn't like options.
All input is taken from stdin.
If you use the protobuf compiler to invoke protoc-gen-go,
see
.BR protoc (1)
for a detailed list of all options.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
